## The 10-Second Hook

**For Twitter/X:**
> I built a life coaching app with 980 unique messages. It knows if it's Monday morning or Sunday night. It knows if you're burnt out or thriving. It runs entirely in your browser. No AI. No data collection. No monthly fee. Just truth.

**For conversation:**
> "It's a prophetic calculator. You move sliders, it tells you exactly what's wrong with your creative life and what to do about it — and the advice changes based on what day and time it is."

## The 30-Second Elevator Pitch

Every creative hits a wall. Burnout. Paralysis. The feeling that you're grinding but going nowhere.

FruitHedge is a creative measurement tool that calculates three scores — your Autonomy, your Resonance, and your Craft Intensity — then tells you exactly what's broken and how to fix it.

But here's what makes it different: it has 980 unique prophetic messages, each written for a specific situation at a specific time. Monday morning burnout gets different advice than Sunday night burnout.

No AI generation. No data collection. No subscription. Just move the sliders, get the truth.

## The 2-Minute Founder Story

I was burning out. Not the dramatic kind — the slow kind. Where you're producing but not progressing. Where the numbers go up but the meaning drains out.

I wanted a tool that could tell me what was actually wrong. Not a personality test that diagnoses and leaves. Not an AI chatbot that hallucinates advice. Something that measures, coaches, and respects my privacy.

So I built FruitHedge.

Three laws. Three scores. One composite number called Creative Alpha that tells you if you're building something real or just performing productivity.

Then I went deeper. I wrote 980 unique prophetic messages — one for every combination of state and time. Because "you're burnt out" hits different at 9am Monday than at 11pm Friday. The advice should too.

The whole thing runs in your browser. No backend. No database. No API calls. Your data never leaves your device.

I didn't build an AI coach. I built crystallized intelligence — human wisdom encoded into a machine that delivers it at exactly the right moment.

A prophet in a bottle.

## Positioning Angles

### Angle 1: Anti-AI
**Headline:** "The Life Coach That Can't Hallucinate"

ChatGPT makes things up. Therapy apps sell your data. Personality tests diagnose but don't coach.

FruitHedge is different. 980 messages written by humans. Delivered by math. No generation. No probability. No mistakes.

Every word was chosen. Every scenario was considered. The machine doesn't think — it selects the exact truth you need to hear.

---

### Angle 2: Privacy-First
**Headline:** "Self-Knowledge Without Surveillance"

Most "wellness" apps harvest your deepest thoughts and sell them to advertisers.

FruitHedge runs entirely in your browser. No accounts. No tracking. No data collection. Your creative vital signs stay on your device.

Privacy isn't our policy. It's our architecture.

---

### Angle 3: Time-Aware Coaching
**Headline:** "The Life Coach That Knows What Day It Is"

Generic advice is useless advice.

FruitHedge knows if it's Monday morning or Friday night. It knows if you're starting the week or ending it. And it speaks to exactly where you are.

980 unique messages across 49 patterns, 5 day contexts, and 4 time slots. Every combination has its own truth.

---

### Angle 4: Calculator Economy
**Headline:** "What If Calculators Could Coach?"

BMI calculators measure. They don't advise.
Personality tests diagnose. They don't coach.
AI chatbots advise. They hallucinate.

FruitHedge does all three — measures, diagnoses, and coaches — with zero AI, zero data collection, and zero monthly fees.

The first prophetic calculator.

---

### Angle 5: Creator-Specific
**Headline:** "Your Creative Vital Signs"

Autonomy: Do you have the freedom to create?
Resonance: Does your work actually land?
Craft Intensity: Are you going deep or just going through motions?

Three numbers. One truth. The rest is noise.

## Objection Handling

**"Isn't this just another personality test?"**
No. Personality tests diagnose and leave. FruitHedge measures, diagnoses, AND coaches — with time-aware advice that changes based on when you use it.

**"Why not just use ChatGPT?"**
ChatGPT hallucinates. It makes things up. FruitHedge has 980 pre-written messages — every word chosen by a human. No probability. No mistakes.

**"How is this different from a horoscope?"**
Horoscopes are generic ("Taurus will have a good week"). FruitHedge measures your actual inputs and matches them to specific patterns. The advice is earned by your data, not assigned by your birthday.

**"Why should I trust the formulas?"**
The three laws are based on established research: autonomy (Self-Determination Theory), resonance (parasocial connection research), and craft intensity (flow state research). The composite uses geometric mean to ensure balance.

**"What if I don't like my results?"**
Then you learned something. The tool doesn't tell you what you want to hear — it tells you what you need to hear. That's the point.

## Press Release Angle

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Creator Launches "Prophetic Calculator" — A Life Coach With 980 Unique Messages and Zero AI**

*FruitHedge delivers time-aware coaching without data collection, subscriptions, or artificial intelligence*

[CITY, DATE] — A new creative measurement tool called FruitHedge launched today, offering what its creator calls "crystallized intelligence" — 980 unique coaching messages delivered based on the user's creative state and the current day and time.

Unlike AI-powered coaching apps that generate responses in real-time, FruitHedge uses pre-written messages matched to specific patterns. "Every word was chosen by a human," says the founder. "The machine doesn't think — it selects."

The tool measures three dimensions of creative health — Autonomy, Resonance, and Craft Intensity — then delivers personalized advice that changes based on whether it's Monday morning or Sunday night.

FruitHedge runs entirely in the browser with no data collection, no user accounts, and no subscription fees.

"I call it a prophet in a bottle," the founder explains. "Wisdom that speaks forever without needing to think."

**About FruitHedge**
FruitHedge is a creative measurement tool that calculates three scores and delivers time-aware coaching through 980 unique prophetic messages. It operates entirely client-side with zero data collection.
