## Season-Specific Considerations

### Weather/Temperature Dependent

| ID | Name | Season Notes |
|----|------|--------------|
| 1 | Morning Walk | Year-round, but may need indoor alternative in extreme weather |
| 6 | Cold Shower Finish | Easier to adopt in summer; harder commitment in winter |
| 9 | Sunlight in Eyes | Harder in winter (late sunrise, overcast); SAD consideration |
| 27 | Visit a Museum or Park | Parks weather-dependent; museums year-round |

### Seasonal Availability

| ID | Name | Season Notes |
|----|------|--------------|
| 44 | Berry Snack | Fresh berries more available/affordable in summer |
| 45 | Melon Hydration | Watermelon is summer fruit; less available in winter |
| 43 | Citrus Morning | Peak citrus season is winter (oranges, grapefruit) |

### No Seasonal Impact
All other protocols (digital habits, mental practices, constraint reduction) work year-round.
